<!-- You are designing a simple calculator for a small grocery shop. The shop sells three items: rice, sugar, and wheat.
Your task is to:
Create variables for the item names, prices, and quantities purchased.
Calculate and display the cost for each item (price × quantity).
Calculate the total bill for the customer.
Change the quantity of one item and recalculate the total.
Display the updated total bill.
Use only what you’ve learned today, and make sure to follow variable naming rules. Output all the values using console.log(). -->
