 <!-- You are building a simple birthday tracker for your friends. You need to:
Create an object named friend with properties: name and birthDate (in the format YYYY-MM-DD).

Write a function getBirthdayDetails that:
    Accepts the friend object as input,
    onverts the birthDate string into a date,
    Extracts and prints the year, month name, and day of the month,
    Calculates how many years old the friend is as of today.
Display the result in the format:
 "John was born on 5 July, 1999 and is 25 years old."
