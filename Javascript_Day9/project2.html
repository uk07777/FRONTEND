<!-- You are creating a simple comment filtering system for a blog site. You need to write a JavaScript function that takes a user's comment and performs the following:
Check whether the comment contains any of the following banned words: "bad", "ugly", or "stupid" (case-insensitive).
If it contains a banned word, replace it with "***" using a regular expression.
Count how many numbers are mentioned in the comment.
Count how many words in the comment begin with a capital letter.
Return a final message with the cleaned comment, number count, and capitalized word count.
Test the function with this comment:
 "I think this movie was BAD and 100% Stupid! But the Acting was Amazing and 3 actors were great.
