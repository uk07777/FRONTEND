<!-- You are building a simple input system for a small game. The game gives players 5 chances to guess a number between 1 and 5. The game should work like this:
Ask the player to enter a number between 1 and 5.
If the number is 3, display: "You guessed it right!" and stop the game.
If the number is not 3, display: "Wrong guess. Try again."
If the player enters a number outside the range (not 1 to 5), display "Invalid input" and skip that chance using continue.
If the player doesnâ€™t guess the correct number within 5 valid chances, display "Game over".
You must use:
A loop
An if-else statement
A break statement
A continue statement
A switch to display the number they entered in words (e.g., 1 = "One") -->
