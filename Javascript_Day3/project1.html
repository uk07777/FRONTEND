<!-- You are helping to build a feedback form for a basic website. When a user submits feedback, you receive a string that may contain extra spaces and mixed cases. Your task is to clean and process the feedback string so it can be stored or displayed neatly.
var feedback = "   I loved the FOOD and the service!   ";

Perform the following actions:

Remove extra spaces at the beginning and end of the string.

Convert the entire string to lowercase.

Replace the word "food" with "ambience".

Find and print the position of the word "service".

Finally, convert the string to an array of words and print the array. -->
